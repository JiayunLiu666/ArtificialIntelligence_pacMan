# ArtificialIntelligence_pacMan
Learned about search problems (A*, CSP, minimax), reinforcement learning and bayes nets. Still in progress.

## Project 1: Search
Goal: Plays Pacman using Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search with different heuristics, which helps pacman find shortest path to eat all dots.

Files edited: search.py, searchAgents.py

## Project 2: Minimax
Goal: Plays Pacman using minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning). 
      · Random ghosts: expectimax
      · Pacman states: evaluation function

## Project 3: Value-iteration
Goal: Markov Decision 
      · Pacman: Q-Learning & Epsilon Greedy; changing noise and discount parameters
      · Approximate Q-values: reinforcement learning

## Project 4: Multi-Agent Pacman
Goal: Belief distribuition of ghost agents based on sequential noise readings and distribution of future ghost agent states. 
      · Pacman: closest likely ghost location & particle filtering
      · Multiple reactive ghosts: joint particle filtering algorithm
